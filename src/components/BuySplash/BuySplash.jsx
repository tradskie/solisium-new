                      <p className='pmainpage1'>Solisium Staking is a high yield, low risk contract that offers 3% daily returns on investment over a period of 180 days bringing this to a total of 540% retun. Based on our SOLS token, this offers a stable and secure passive income stream for all users. Why is it stable? Because this is backed by a liquidity insurance vault that is automatically used in case of potential drainage. Different form most staking contracts, SOLS is a non-inflationary token, liquidity being provided by a 10% tax on all transactions and initial investment burning, constantly replenishing the liquidity pool.</p>

                      <p className='pmainpage1'>Solisium SOLPounding is our spin of a high yield high risk contract that offers 8% daily return with a 9 day compound requirement and 1 day claim in a period of 10 days. This is necessary so everyone can profit without drainage issues. We do not have a lock on claiming but we trust that everyone will follow these rules. For those that don't they risk being blacklisted, loosing their staked SOLS and returns. Liquidity pool is separate from the 3% daily pool so there is no risk of drainage of the entire liquidity.</p>
